# Project-100

I started a very ambitious project... 365 Days of Code Challenge! Similar in nature to the [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), I will be spending a minimum of 1 hour each day of 2021 working on a personal project hopefully learning a thing or two and improving my coding abilities. I intend to work on a couple of projects, each containing elements that should push me out of my comfort zone and allow me to expand my knowledge and skill set. You can check out my plans in the video below:

It would make my day if this encourages even one person to sign up to the 100 Days Challenge. You can find out more about the challenge here: https://www.100daysofcode.com/. Reach out if you are starting a coding challenge project of your own, I'd love to check it out.

If you are looking for a personal roadmap into your chosen career or aren't sure which area of tech you want to pursue, go take the 3 minute quiz

## Day 1
Spent a good couple of hours setting up and configuring Gatsby, Contentful and Netlify as the foundation to the first project.
Worked a little on bringing the exisiting navbar and landing page to the newsite with Styled-Components.
